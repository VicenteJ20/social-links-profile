## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Github Pages

### What I learned

I'm gonna be honest, I know HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, since more than 1 year ago, so I don't really learned anything new with this solution. I just made it because it was on my list and I wanted to complete all the challenges on it.
